# Emergency presentations for older persons with low back pain: an increasing clinical and economic challenge
This repository contains the code files and folder structure associated with a research project (see title). Data is not provided, but the structure of folders reflects the structure used when running the code files to generate the results in the manuscript.

## Code Files
All code files are RMD files and written to facilitate readability rather than to be particularly consise or efficient.
- **Data Cleaning.RMD** performs the initial cleaning of the Emergency Department data.
- **Data Preparation - Tables.RMD** and **Data Preparation - Modelling.RMD** further processes the cleaned data for easy use in analyses involving table construction and model development respectively.
- **Analyses - Tables.RMD** creates the tables reported in the manuscript. This file calls on helper files stored in the **Code/Table Functions/** folder.
- **Analyses - Modelling.RMD** fits a logistic regression model through an iterative (and manual) forward stepwise procedure.
